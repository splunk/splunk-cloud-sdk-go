Freshness is applied to the resolvedEarliest and resolvedLatest parameters. If an existing search has the same exact criteria as this search and the resolvedEarliest and resolvedLatest values are within the freshness interval, the existing search metadata is returned instead of initiating a new search job. By default, the requiredFreshness parameter is set to 0 which means that the platform does not attempt to use an existing search.
